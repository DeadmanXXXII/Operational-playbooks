🕴️ Red Team Operational Playbook

Operation Name: Frontman

While they watch you they miss what's really happening.

---

🎯 Objective

To gather internal intelligence while drawing attention to oneself in a benign or misdirected manner. The operator ("Frontman") becomes a distraction vector, enabling reconnaissance of secured spaces, people, and infrastructure under the guise of confusion, charisma, or accident.


---

🧠 Concept Summary

"Frontman" is a dual-purpose diversion and collection op. The operator appears oblivious or eccentric enough to justify accidental access while intentionally observing and recording critical details, such as:

Physical layout

Security mechanisms including staff and cameras.

Employee behavior

Access control workflows

Emergency egress routes


The goal is not stealth, but controlled attention — you are the show. While security is watching you, they're missing what you’re team is doing.

🛠️ Tactics & Techniques

Distraction Mode	Description

🧍 “Lost and Loud”	Pretend to be lost or confused. Ask for restrooms, exits, or conference rooms.
🚿 “Environmental Event”	Activate a minor physical element (e.g. fire alarm box, HVAC vent, sprinkler test valve) to draw attention.
📱 “Look Like You Belong”	Carry a clipboard, walkie, tablet, or wear reflective gear. Speak confidently.
🎭 “Accidental Artist”	Cause a small scene: drop coffee, fumble phone, trip. Create a moment.
👀 “Point and Pivot”	Point out a fake incident in the opposite direction to mislead security.

🔍 Recon Targets During Operation

Entry systems: badge readers, mantraps, tailgate gaps

Visitor protocols: signage, sign-in desks, lanyards

Networking hardware: switch closets, AP placements, wall jacks

Emergency routes: fire exits, stairwells, alarm override panels

Employee identifiers: ID badges, uniforms, passwords on Post-Its

Security personnel routines: who responds, how fast, what tools


---

🪤 Execution Steps

1. Plan Two Layers:

Primary distraction: The character and event you’ll trigger.

Secondary recon or operations goal: The data or visual intel you need.


2. Choose Entry Point:

Preferably during high foot traffic hours (shift changes, lunch).


3. Implement the Distraction:

Execute convincingly. Act like you belong or are helpless.

Engage people: social engineering thrives on empathy or confusion.


4. Observe & Extract:

Use peripheral vision, wearable camera, smart glasses, or mental notes.

Identify routes, room labels, tech stacks, signage.

5. Exit Naturally:

“Sorry, wrong building.” “I’m just here for the delivery.” “That’s embarrassing!” Leave casually or be escorted out.

🛡️ Risk & Contingency

Risk	Mitigation

Escalation to Law Enforcement	Stay non-confrontational; feign ignorance
Recognized by Staff	Rotate operator identities; keep cover story loose
Security Tech Flag (CCTV, RFID)	Mask key identifiers; time overlap with crowd
Unexpected Questioning	Redirect: “You’ll have to ask my supervisor”



---

📸 Intel Artifacts to Collect

Photos or sketches of:

Badge templates or colors

Internal directories or room names

Fire escape plans (usually posted on walls)


Notes on:

Security desk behavior

Entry delays or tailgating gaps

Ambient conversations mentioning names/systems




---

🧰 Tools of the Trade

Tool	Use Case

Clipboards/Tablets	Appear as maintenance or audit personnel
Reflective vest	Implicit trust enabler
Wearable cameras	Covert recording of layout and signage
Burner phone	Feigned calls or excuses for presence
Fake documents	Work orders, delivery slips, inspection logs



---

🔁 Follow-Up Ops Enabled by “Frontman”

“Ghost Step” (cloaked physical entry now that you know layout)

“Cloner” (badge duplication or tailgating using badge insights)

“Dead Drop” (cache small payloads in vents, ceiling tiles, toilets)

“Surge” (planting rogue devices in understaffed zones)

📄 Sample Cover Stories

"I’m the new fire suppression inspector — where’s the riser room?"

"Sorry! I’m supposed to be in 7A, but the door says IT. That’s not finance?"

"We’re checking vent mold reports, are these mechanical schematics?"

"Thats a fancy lanyard big chap I bet your important can you help me please."

"OMG that security, patrol, sniff, attack dog is so cute. Who's a cuties little puppies. I bet your real clever too, can they have a treat."

"What's that happening over there is that my other distraction happening."

---

✅ Success Criteria

Exit with internal knowledge: layout, access control, response time

Evoke curiosity, not suspicion

Trigger no security incident reports
